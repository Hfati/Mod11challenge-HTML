# Mod11challenge-HTML
I am now ready to tackle a full web-scraping and data analysis project. I have gained the ability to recognize HTML elements on a webpage, determine their id and class attributes, and utilize this knowledge to extract information using both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I have also become skilled at scraping various types of information. I will discuss some examples, such as HTML tables and recurring elements, such as multiple news articles on a webpage.
As you tackle this Challenge, keep in mind that you are honing the fundamental skills you have been cultivating thus far: gathering data, arranging and storing data, examining data, and effectively conveying your findings visually.
